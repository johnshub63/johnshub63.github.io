<h1>Hello, I’m John</h1>

<p>
  This is my personal space on the internet.
</p>

<p>
  It’s a place for writing, travel notes, leadership ideas, family history,
  photographs, and things I want to think about slowly and keep hold of.
</p>

<p>
  Some of this is polished. Some of it is in progress. All of it is human.
